# OpenCode as an AI backend

Craft Anything can run OpenCode V2 locally or on an SSH host. OpenCode owns its provider
connections and sign-in. Set these up in OpenCode on the computer where it will run.

Model and thinking choices can be discovered, validated and saved. A run with an explicit
selection goes through the native adapter (`opencode run --standalone`), which hands the run
the Craft Anything MCP server in a config file named by `OPENCODE_CONFIG`; the person's own
settings stay unchanged. Over SSH one `ssh` run checks that `craft-anything-cli` is on the
remote PATH and writes the file on the host itself (`~/.cache/craft-anything/`, named by its
content, kept private), so the remote run gets the same tools. The host needs
`craft-anything-cli` on its PATH — install Craft Anything there (the app keeps the helper
next to it). If the check fails, the turn stops before any work with the fix.

**Which OpenCode.** Runs need OpenCode 2.x, whose `run` has `--standalone`. OpenCode's install
script and npm's `opencode-ai` package still give the 1.x line (1.19.5 on 2026-11-08), which
doesn't have it. 2.x comes from npm's `@opencode/cli` package (`npm install -g @opencode/cli`),
with the OpenCode desktop app, whose CLI is `opencode-cli` in the app's resources folder
(`/opt/OpenCode/resources/opencode-cli` from the Linux package), and from OpenCode's GitHub
releases. When the `opencode` on your PATH is 1.x, install `@opencode/cli`, or point the backend
at a 2.x CLI: step 2 below, or `craft-anything-cli ai program OpenCode <path>`.

**Don't start OpenCode during a build.** OpenCode's shared service resumes every session it finds
running, including the one a build's private server is driving: started mid-build (opening the
desktop app does it), it ran the builder's commands alongside the build, and the turn ended with
an error that had no details. Open the desktop app before or after a build, not during one.

## Desktop

1. Open **Settings → AI → Detect**, then add **OpenCode**, or **OpenCode on `<host>`**.
   Remote suggestions come from SSH aliases; they do not confirm that OpenCode is installed.
2. If needed, choose the local program, or enter its full path in **Remote program**.
3. Under the backend, click **Change…** to load the models from that OpenCode installation.
4. Choose a model and, if available, a **Thinking depth**, then **Apply**.

The model picker lists only enabled chat models returned by OpenCode. Provider/model ids
distinguish similarly named models and preserve custom aliases. The five thinking depths are
**Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **Xhigh** and **Max**; only those reported as variants of the
selected model are offered. A model can offer fewer depths, or none.

**OpenCode default** delegates model choice to OpenCode. **Model default** leaves thinking to
the selected model. Changing the draft model resets its draft thinking depth. **Reload models**
refreshes both lists after provider or configuration changes. A missing saved model or variant
is marked unavailable; there is no fallback catalogue or silent downgrade.

Discovery runs in the background with deadlines and output limits. Listing models launches
the selected OpenCode process, may start its background service, and may update its cache;
discovery is not read-only. Local queries explicitly use the current project directory;
SSH queries use the remote shell's working directory, as the existing remote runner does.
Local model lists are never substituted for a remote one.
Changing the program, backend settings or project invalidates an open picker. Saving an explicit
choice checks it against the selected installation's live catalogue.
If another task holds the session, opening or reloading the picker asks you to retry rather
than querying without the project directory. An already open picker keeps its draft and any
matching background result until the session can be checked again.
If validation fails or is cancelled, the conversation emits its error or stopped status followed
by a terminal turn event, so headless chat finishes without waiting for an agent that never started.

## CLI

```sh
craft-anything-cli ai add OpenCode --kind agent_cli --model opencode
craft-anything-cli ai model OpenCode
craft-anything-cli ai model OpenCode my-provider/my-model --thinking high
craft-anything-cli ai model OpenCode --thinking max
craft-anything-cli ai model OpenCode --default

craft-anything-cli ai add "OpenCode on studio" --kind agent_cli --model opencode --ssh-host studio
craft-anything-cli ai program "OpenCode on studio" /opt/opencode/bin/opencode
craft-anything-cli ai model "OpenCode on studio"
```

Replace `my-provider/my-model` with an id from the listing. Listing an OpenCode backend also
returns each model's supported `thinking` values. Naming a new model without `--thinking`
uses that model's default depth. `--thinking` alone applies to the configured explicit model.

The `ai_models_list` and `ai_model_set` tools expose the same discovery and validation to MCP
and other headless clients. For example, `ai_model_set` accepts
`{"name":"OpenCode","model":"my-provider/my-model","thinking":"high"}`. Omit both
`model` and `thinking` to restore the OpenCode default.
`ai_models_list` returns a total and a page controlled by `offset` and `limit` (200 by default,
at most 1000); the desktop picker and `ai model` command load the whole bounded catalogue.

## Configuration and execution

The agent identity stays `model = "opencode"`. Its optional choices are saved separately:

```toml
[[ai.backends]]
name = "OpenCode"
kind = "agent_cli"
model = "opencode"
cli_model = "my-provider/my-model"
cli_thinking = "high"
```

These fields extend the existing versioned settings file. Old settings without them retain
OpenCode's defaults; a known variant embedded in an existing `cli_model` reference is read into
`cli_thinking`. A model-only command uses `opencode run --model provider/model`;
adding a thinking depth uses `opencode run --model provider/model#variant`.
The shared `Effort` type represents all five levels. OpenCode's `cli_thinking` remains a separate
setting from API/Claude `effort`: an unavailable OpenCode variant is refused, never stepped down.
Hub and tool selections use the same save path: reread the settings file strictly, preserve unrelated
disk changes, and reject a changed backend or project. Malformed settings are left untouched, and
the session is updated only after a successful save.
Closing the app also preserves the latest AI selection. If a running tool holds the session,
pending non-AI app settings are kept in `config.pending.toml` instead of waiting for the tool or
overwriting its settings. At the next startup they are merged with the latest saved AI table;
the sidecar is removed after recovery or a successful full exit save that supersedes it.
It uses the existing settings schema and migrations; unreadable or newer files are not overwritten
by recovery.
The current ACP transport cannot select models or variants. An explicit choice bypasses ACP
even if `acp = true` was previously set and runs natively. OpenCode V2 ignores
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, and plain `opencode run` hands the turn to the background service,
which never sees the run's environment; so the adapter writes the server to a config file
and starts a private server with `--standalone` (locally in this computer's temporary
folder, over SSH on the host itself). V2 names a tool call `id` (V1: `callID`); both
are read, so tool calls reach the feed while the turn runs.

A `--standalone` turn still keeps its session in OpenCode's shared storage. If the turn is
stopped part-way, the session stays `running`, and the background service picks it up the next
time it starts and carries on with the builder's commands (#1115, seen with 2.2.5 on Windows).
So a local turn that doesn't finish (stopped, failed or timed out) deletes its session with
`opencode session delete --standalone <id>`, which removes it without resuming it (over SSH, on
the host). A turn that finishes keeps its session. While a turn runs, its session is recorded in
`logs/unfinished-sessions/` in the config folder, under a lock the system drops when Craft
Anything ends; if Craft Anything is killed mid-turn, the desktop app sweeps the records when it
starts, and the next agent turn or `craft-anything-cli uninstall` does too. A delete that
keeps failing is given up after three tries, with the command to run by hand.

Model discovery uses `opencode api model.list --param location[directory]=...` (the V2
`GET /api/model` operation). This keeps credentials and configuration resolution inside OpenCode.
Global `--server` and `--standalone` arguments are shared with discovery. Without a `--server`,
discovery adds `--standalone` itself, as runs do: plain `api` starts OpenCode's shared service,
which resumes every unfinished session on the computer, in any project, and carries on with its
commands (#1115). The model check before each turn is a discovery, so without it every build could
wake an old session somewhere else. Extra model arguments
remain available when no model or thinking selection is saved. With an explicit selection,
conflicting extra model arguments are refused; choose the model through its settings instead.
