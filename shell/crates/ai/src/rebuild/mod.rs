//! The rebuild workflow: study a target, have a coding agent build it in the workspace's `app/`
//! folder, check the build against the target, and refine — asking the person when needed.
//!
//! ```text
//! Study   website: web_site_open + web_site_capture → capture/   (screenshots, blueprint, HTML)
//!         local:   triage (+ app graph for JS apps)  → capture/README.md
//! Build   the coding agent (an agent CLI such as Claude Code) works in the workspace with our
//!         MCP server; edits outside app/ and unusual commands ask the person (core_action_approve),
//!         questions arrive as cards (core_person_ask). Both go through the workspace inbox.
//! Check   website: serve app/dist on loopback, capture it the same way, compare screenshots
//!         (layout similarity per width). Other stacks: the build must succeed.
//! Refine  measured differences go back to the agent, up to `max_rounds`.
//! ```
//!
//! Everything runs on one worker thread; the UI drains [`RunEvent`]s with [`RebuildRun::poll`].
//!
//! Modules: `kinds` (what is made: [`TargetKind`]s and [`Check`]s), `study`, `brief` (the builder's prompts), `check`,
//! `locate` (what to study in a local target) and `output` (what a build produced).
