//! What is being made. Each kind of target (website, app, game) is a [`TargetKind`]: how a
//! request is recognised as one, its default stack, what the builder is told, and the
//! [`Check`]s that judge a build. A [`KindRegistry`] holds them; add a kind by implementing the
//! trait and calling [`KindRegistry::register`].
