//! Questions about a build ("Just ask"): "where are the latest files?", "why did it pick
//! Bevy?". They're answered without starting a build or a round, and nothing is changed:
//!
//! - a coding agent that keeps a session (Claude Code) answers from a copy of the builder's own
//!   session (`--fork-session`), which isn't kept, with only Read, Glob and Grep (none in Clean
//!   room) and no tool server, so the builder's session and files stay as they are;
//! - Copilot starts a fresh ACP session with no tool server: only view, glob and grep in Deep
//!   mode, no tools in Clean room. It answers from the project context, not the builder's chat;
//! - an AI with an API key answers with our agent loop on a [`ReadOnlyHost`]: the engine's tools
//!   that change nothing, pointed at this project in an engine of its own;
//! - any other agent is refused, since it can't be held to reading.
//!
//! Every question carries what the project is and its most recently changed files, so a plain
//! "where is…" is answered even without tools.
