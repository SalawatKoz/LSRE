//! How each agent CLI is driven: its arguments, the flags it must have, how its output stream
//! reads, and anything it needs before a run (a sign-in check). Each is an [`AgentAdapter`]; an
//! [`AgentAdapters`] registry maps agent ids to them, and an agent it doesn't know gets the plain
//! adapter (prompt in, text out). Add an agent by implementing the trait and registering it.
